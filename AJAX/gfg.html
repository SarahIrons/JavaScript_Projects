<!-- I had to work on de-bugging several ways on this assignment. I found guidance on Kinsta.come. Here is a walk-through of how it went and my notes on the assignment: 
		XAMPP was not loading and I added a line to config the port to 'local host:8080' instead of simply reading as 'localhost'. 
		I saved and closed Apache and ran it again.  
		In order to execute this assignment: I placed the two relevant HTML (files taken from GeeksforGeeks) into my computer's htdocs folder so that XAMPP would recognize where to retrieve the files. 
		I ran the program through Microsoft Edge (which I think may have been on suggestion of one of the sites I reviewed when debugging--I dont' know if it was helpful to run on this browser vs others. 
		I was able to execute the function and run it; thus allowing a second page to render when a button is clicked on first page.  -->
