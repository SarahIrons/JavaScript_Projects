# JavaScript_Projects
Tech Academy JavaScript Course work
This is the repo for JavaScript project work. During this course I will implement JavaScript to improve upon past HTML/CSS projects and hone skills around JS functions. 

#[Tic Tac Toe Game](TicTacToe)
This is a project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The font for the heading and the game tiles is an SVG font that I manipulated as an image using Photopea. 

#[Calculator](Calculator) This is a functional calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#[Pizza Menu App](PizzaProject) This is a clickable menu to order a pizza, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JS functions allow for orders to be tallied with different toppings/size permutations. 

#[AJAX assignment](AJAX) In this course section, we set up a XAMPP web server environment. This assignment demonstrated the onReadyState function.

#[jQuery Assignment](jQueryChallenge) This exercise demonstrated calling jQuery functions: there is a brief demo of a click event, and an effect (show/hide of text).

#[Updated Portfolio Site with JS](Portfolio) We revisited/updated our project from our HTML/CSS course and added JavaScript to it. The personal portfolio page has a slideshow and a contact form.
