# JavaScript_Projects
Tech Academy JavaScript Course work
This is the repo for JavaScript project work. During this course I will implement JavaScript to improve upon past HTML/CSS projects and hone skills around JS functions. 

#[Tic Tac Toe Game](TicTacToe)
This is a project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The font for the heading is an SVG font that I manipulated as an image using Photopea. 

#[Calculator](Calculator) This is a functional calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#[Pizza Menu App](PizzaProject) This is a clickable menu to order a pizza, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JS functions allow for orders to be tallied with different toppings/size permutations.
